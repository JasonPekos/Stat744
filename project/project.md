#project.md


> due Mon Nov 1: Write one paragraph about a possible project you might consider doing. You should talk about a possible data set, and also about what kind of visualization interests you. Please put it in the main directory of your repo and call it project.md.




I'd be interested in doing some data analysis on animal movement data, e.g. using the 'move' package in R, and some data from: 

https://www.movebank.org/cms/movebank-main.


I know absolutely nothing about this area, so I can't suggest too much, but some basic ideas include:

- Animated movement over some spatial map
- plotting e.g. speed / daily(?) displacement histograms
- splitting up the prior plot to different individuals to look for patterns?
