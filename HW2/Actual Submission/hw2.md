*Q1*: write a short statement (a few sentences) that explains what question you think the graphic is trying to answer, or what pattern it’s trying to display*

**A:**  The purpose of the graph is to demonstrate the efficacy of the Measles vaccine by plotting the time series of measles cases each year before and after the introduction of the Measles vaccine. The pattern is a clear decrease in the prevalence of the disease — represented by the area of the blue circles — in the years following the vaccine rollout.

*Q2*: based on these data, create 2 ggplots that display the data in a different way from the original; use the 2 plots to illustrate tradeoffs between different graphical principles. (If you’re feeling truly uncreative, one of your plots can replicate the original graphical design.) You do not need to worry about the dynamic-graphics aspect or the historical events shown in the original display.




## Graph One

For my first graph, I tried simply representing the data as a scatterplot: the Wilke book seems to suggest that this is a pretty good first step with time series data. The main issue is that there is a pretty large amount of noise
